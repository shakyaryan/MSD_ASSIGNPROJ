    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "e.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "- a washing machine : you press one button(function)  and it does washing  , rinsing  , and  drying without repeating steps manually\n",
    "\n",
    "-  a restautant menu : instead of writing recipes again and again , the chef just calls the \"recipe function\"  whenever someone orders the dish\n",
