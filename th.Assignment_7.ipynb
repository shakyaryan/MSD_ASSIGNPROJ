    "\n",

    "The feature responsible for generating **Regex objects** in Python is the **`re.compile()` function** from the **`re` module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you call `re.compile(pattern)`, Python compiles the given regex pattern into a **RegexObject**, which can then be reused for matching, searching, or splitting without recompiling the pattern every time.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compile the regex pattern\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r\"\\d+\")\n",
