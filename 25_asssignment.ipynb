    "1. What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "   Square brackets around a comprehension produce a list immediately — all items are computed and stored in memory. Parentheses produce a generator expression (not a list); it computes items lazily as you iterate and does not store everything at once, so it uses less memory for large sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "   A generator is a specific kind of iterator. Generators produce iterator objects (either from a generator function or a generator expression) that implement the iterator protocol: they have an **iter** method that returns themselves and a **next** method that yields the next value. In short, every generator is an iterator, but not every iterator is a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "   A function that contains the keyword yield (or yield from) is a generator function. When you call it, it does not run the body immediately; instead it returns a generator object. The presence of yield in the function body is the telltale sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "   Yield produces a value to the caller and pauses the function’s execution, preserving its local state so it can resume later from the same place. This lets the function generate a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, without building the whole sequence in memory. Yield can also accept values sent back into the generator and is a building block for coroutines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "   Both map and list comprehensions are ways to transform sequences. Key comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Output type: In Python 3, map returns an iterator (lazy); a list comprehension produces a list immediately. A generator expression (parentheses) is the lazy analogue of list comprehension.\n",
    "* Syntax and readability: List comprehensions embed the expression directly and tend to be more readable and Pythonic for simple transformations and when you want to filter (they support if clauses). Map requires a function object and can look less clear when combined with lambda.\n",
    "* Flexibility: List comprehensions support filtering (if) and nested loops naturally. map can accept multiple iterables and apply a function that takes multiple arguments, which is slightly different but achievable with zip in a comprehension.\n",
    "* Performance: Differences are minor and context-dependent. For simple built-in functions, map can be slightly faster; for complex expressions, list comprehensions often win. For large data, using the lazy map or generator expression avoids building the whole list in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice choose list comprehensions for clarity, map for simple function application when you already have a function, and use generator expressions or map when you need lazy evaluation.\n"
