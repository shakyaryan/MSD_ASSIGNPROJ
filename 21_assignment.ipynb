    "You open or create the file **today.txt** and write today’s date into it as plain text (for example “2025-11-13”). This saves the current date inside the file.\n",

    "You open **today.txt**, read the content inside it, and store that text in a variable called **today_string**. This variable now contains the date you wrote earlier.\n",

    "\n",
    "You create three independent worker processes. Each process pauses for a randomly chosen time between 1 and 5 seconds, then prints the current time, and then stops. All three run at the same time, so their outputs appear in random order.\n",
