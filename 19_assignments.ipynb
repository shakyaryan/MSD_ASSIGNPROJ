    "1. Create a class called Thing with no contents and print it. Then, create an object called example from this class and also print it. Are the printed values the same or different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A class named Thing is created using the pass statement. When the class itself is printed, it displays information about the class definition. When an object is created from the class and printed, it shows the object’s memory location. Therefore, the printed values are different — one represents the class, and the other represents the object instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new class called Thing2 and add the value 'abc' to the letters class attribute. Letters should be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A class Thing2 is created with a class attribute named letters containing the value 'abc'. When the class attribute is printed, it displays 'abc'. Class attributes belong to the class itself and can be accessed without creating an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make yet another class called Thing3. This time, assign the value 'xyz' to an instance (object) attribute called letters. Print letters. Do you need to make an object from the class to do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In the class Thing3, the attribute letters is defined as an instance attribute. This means that each object created from the class has its own copy of the attribute. To access and print the value of letters, an object must first be created from the class. Yes, an object is required to access instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create an Element class with the instance attributes name, symbol, and number. Create a class object with the values 'Hydrogen', 'H', and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A class Element is created with three instance attributes: name, symbol, and number. These are set using the constructor method when an object is created. An object named hydrogen is then created with the values 'Hydrogen', 'H', and 1 representing its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a dictionary with these keys and values: 'name': 'Hydrogen', 'symbol': 'H', 'number': 1. Then, create an object called hydrogen from class Element using this dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A dictionary is created containing the keys and values for name, symbol, and number. The dictionary is then used to create an Element object by passing its values as arguments to the class. This is done by unpacking the dictionary, allowing the object hydrogen to be created with the same attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For the Element class, define a method called dump() that prints the values of the object’s attributes (name, symbol, and number). Create the hydrogen object from this new definition and use dump() to print its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A method named dump() is added inside the Element class. This method prints all three attribute values of the object. When the hydrogen object is created and the dump() method is called, it prints the values of name, symbol, and number.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Call print(hydrogen). In the definition of Element, change the name of method dump to **str**, create a new hydrogen object, and call print(hydrogen) again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "When the method name is changed to **str**, it becomes a special method that defines how the object should appear when printed. Instead of calling dump(), print(hydrogen) now automatically displays the formatted string defined inside **str**, showing the attribute values in a readable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Modify Element to make the attributes name, symbol, and number private. Define a getter property for each to return its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The attributes name, symbol, and number are made private by prefixing them with double underscores. Getter methods are then created using the @property decorator to allow controlled access to these attributes. This ensures data encapsulation and prevents direct modification of the private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Define three classes: Bear, Rabbit, and Octothorpe. For each, define only one method: eats(). This should return 'berries' (Bear), 'clover' (Rabbit), or 'campers' (Octothorpe). Create one object from each and print what it eats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Three separate classes are defined, each representing a different animal. Each class contains one method named eats() that returns a unique string describing what the animal eats. Objects are created from each class, and calling their eats() methods prints what each one consumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Define these classes: Laser, Claw, and SmartPhone. Each has only one method: does(). This returns 'disintegrate' (Laser), 'crush' (Claw), or 'ring' (SmartPhone). Then, define the class Robot that has one instance (object) of each of these. Define a does() method for the Robot that prints what its component objects do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Three classes, Laser, Claw, and SmartPhone, are defined, each with a does() method that describes its function. A fourth class, Robot, is created to combine one instance of each of these three classes. The Robot class also has its own does() method that calls and displays the actions of its components, showing how each part of the robot operates.\n"
