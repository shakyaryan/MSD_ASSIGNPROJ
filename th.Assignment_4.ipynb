    "* `append()` adds an element **at the end of the list**.\n",
    "* `insert()` adds an element **at a specific position** in the list, shifting other elements to the right.\n",

    "1. `remove(value)` → deletes the **first occurrence** of a specified value.\n",

    "* `copy.copy()` creates a **shallow copy**, meaning only the top-level elements are copied; nested objects are shared.\n",
