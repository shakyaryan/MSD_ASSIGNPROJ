    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. The Alpha value represents the transparency of the color.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any image?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the getpixel() method on an Image object. For example:\n",
    "img.getpixel((x, y)) returns the RGBA value of the pixel at coordinates (x, y).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A box tuple defines a rectangular region in an image and is specified as (left, top, right, bottom).\n",
    "It is used in methods like crop() to define which part of the image to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use your image and load in notebook then, how can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the size attribute of the Image object.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "width, height = img.size\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the crop() method.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "croppedImg = img.crop((50, 0, 100, 100))\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the save() method.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "img.save('newImage.png')\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ImageDraw module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageDraw objects have drawing methods.\n",
    "You can get one by passing the Image object to ImageDraw.Draw(), for example:\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n"
