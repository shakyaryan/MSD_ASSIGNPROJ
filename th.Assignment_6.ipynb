    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **backslash `\\`** is an **escape character** in programming. It gives special meaning to the character that follows it, such as `\\n` for a new line or `\\t` for a tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you want to include a **real backslash** in your string (so it appears as `\\` in output), you need to **escape the backslash itself** by writing it **twice**: `\\\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why:** A single backslash tells the program “the next character is special.” Using two backslashes tells the program “I want an actual backslash here.”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shortcut:** You can also use a **raw string** by placing an `r` before the string. This tells the program to treat all backslashes **literally** without interpreting them as escape characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Real-life Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Writing Windows file paths**: A file path like `C:\\Users\\Documents` needs the backslashes to appear properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Displaying a backslash in text**: When explaining escape sequences, you often need to show a real backslash, like in “Use `\\` to escape characters.”\n",
