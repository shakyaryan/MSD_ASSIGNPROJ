    "1. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable spam is a negative integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   assert spam >= 0, 'spam should not be a negative integer'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   assert eggs.lower() != bacon.lower(), 'eggs and bacon should not be the same ignoring case'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   assert False, 'This assertion always fails'\n",

    "4. What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call logging.debug()?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named programLog.txt?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "   logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the five levels of logging?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   The five levels of logging are debug, info, warning, error, and critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Logging messages are better because they provide different levels of importance, can be written to files, and can be easily enabled or disabled without changing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Step Over runs the current line without entering functions. Step In goes inside the called function to debug its code. Step Out finishes the current function and returns to the caller line.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The debugger will stop when it reaches the next breakpoint or when the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A breakpoint is a marked line in the code where the debugger pauses execution so the programmer can check variable values and program behavior.\n"
