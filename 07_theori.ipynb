    "Sure 🙂 here are the answers in **normal, simple theory form** — easy to read and understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, PyInputPlus is not part of the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "It is a third-party module that needs to be installed separately using the command `pip install pyinputplus`.\n",
    "The Python Standard Library includes built-in modules, but PyInputPlus is not one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with `import pyinputplus as pypi`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "PyInputPlus is commonly imported as `pypi` to make it easier and shorter to use in programs.\n",
    "Instead of writing `pyinputplus.inputInt()`, we can simply write `pypi.inputInt()`.\n",
    "It saves typing and makes the code look cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. How do you distinguish between `inputInt()` and `inputFloat()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `inputInt()` function allows only whole numbers (integers) as input.\n",
    "The `inputFloat()` function allows decimal numbers as input.\n",
    "For example, entering `10` works for both, but entering `10.5` will only work with `inputFloat()` and not with `inputInt()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `inputInt()` function with `min` and `max` arguments like this:\n",
    "`pyinputplus.inputInt(min=0, max=99)`\n",
    "This makes sure that the user enters an integer value and that it lies between 0 and 99.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments `allowRegexes` and `blockRegexes`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `allowRegexes` argument is used to specify a list of regular expressions that are allowed as valid input.\n",
    "The `blockRegexes` argument is used to specify a list of regular expressions that should be rejected as invalid input.\n",
    "They help in controlling what kind of text inputs are accepted or blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3)` do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user enters a blank input three times, the function stops asking for input and raises a `RetryLimitException` error.\n",
    "This happens because the limit of 3 tries has been reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. If a blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3, default='hello')` do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user enters blank input three times, the function will not show an error.\n",
    "Instead, it will return the default value `'hello'` after the three failed attempts.\n",
    "So, the program continues smoothly using `'hello'` as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to make this in a **question–answer notebook format** (like how it appears in school notes)?\n"
